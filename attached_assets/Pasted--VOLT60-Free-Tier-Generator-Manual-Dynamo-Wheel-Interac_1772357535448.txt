⚡ VOLT60 – Free Tier Generator
“Manual Dynamo Wheel” — Interaction Design Spec
🎯 Core Concept

Free users generate electricity (Watts) by manually rotating a physical power wheel.

This should feel:

Mechanical

Heavy

Industrial

Rewarding with motion physics

NOT a simple tap button.

The user should feel like they are physically producing energy.

Centerpiece (70% of screen)

3D Industrial Generator Wheel

Visual style:

Rusted iron + brass bolts

Slight oil stains

Neon electric-blue energy pulses

Connected to cables going into the grid

Think:

submarine engine + power plant turbine.

🎮 User Interaction (IMPORTANT)
✅ The user DOES NOT TAP repeatedly.

Instead:

👉 User GRABS AND ROTATES the wheel

Interaction:

Touch wheel

Drag clockwise

Wheel follows finger rotation

This creates natural engagement.

Gesture Mechanics
Input Logic

User touches wheel edge.

App calculates finger angle around center.

Movement rotates wheel accordingly.

Example logic:

angle = atan2(touchY - centerY, touchX - centerX)
rotation += deltaAngle
Energy Generation Formula

Power generated depends on rotation speed:

Watts Generated = Rotation Speed × Torque Multiplier

So:

Slow spin → small watts
Fast spin → high watts

⚙️ Wheel Physics (VERY IMPORTANT)

Without physics it feels fake.

Add:

✅ Momentum

Wheel continues spinning briefly after release

✅ Friction

Slowly loses speed

✅ Resistance

Harder to spin fast

Feeling Target:

Like turning:

Ship steering wheel

Old generator crank

Heavy industrial machinery

✨ Animation Behavior
While spinning:
1️⃣ Mechanical Motion

Wheel rotates smoothly

Bolts blur slightly at high speed

2️⃣ Energy Activation

As speed increases:

Speed	Visual Effect
Low	Small sparks
Medium	Blue energy flowing
High	Electric arcs + glow
3️⃣ Cable Energy Flow

Energy pulses travel through cables into world map nodes.

Nodes start glowing brighter.

This creates:
👉 Cause → Effect satisfaction.

🧠 Manual Stress System

Prevents infinite grinding.

Stress Meter increases when spinning fast.

If meter hits 100%:

Wheel jams briefly

Steam burst animation

Cooldown 5–10 seconds

UI Message:

“SYSTEM OVERHEATED”

Then resets slowly.

🔊 Feedback (CRITICAL FOR ADDICTION)
Sound Layers

Metal creaking loop

Generator hum increasing with speed

Electrical crackle at high power

Reward chime every milestone

🧩 Micro Rewards

Every few rotations:

⚡ "+120W"

"+450W COMBO"

Small floating numbers appear near wheel.

🎯 Goal Psychology

User sees:

NEXT MILESTONE:
1 MW → Unlock Solar License

This pushes upgrade conversion.

React + Vite

Canvas OR SVG wheel

Framer Motion OR GSAP for animation

Telegram WebApp SDK

Required Components
1. Wheel Component
<GeneratorWheel />

Handles:

drag rotation

inertia physics

power calculation

2. Physics Loop

Use requestAnimationFrame:

velocity *= 0.97 // friction
rotation += velocity
generatePower(velocity)
3. Touch Handling

Use pointer events:

onPointerDown
onPointerMove
onPointerUp
4. Power Engine

Backend-safe calculation:

server validates watts/sec limit

(prevents cheating)

🎨 Visual Upgrade Path (Psychology Trick)

Free wheel should look:

OLD

HARD WORK

NOISY

So when users see:

Solar → clean

Diesel → powerful

Fusion → godlike

…the upgrade feels emotionally necessary.

⭐ GOLDEN RULE

Free tier must feel:

“I am working hard for small energy.”

Paid tiers must feel:

“The machine works for me.”

If you want next, I can design the exact motion progression between:

👉 Wheel (Free) → Solar tracking → Diesel throttle → Fusion automation

…so the gameplay evolution feels addictive and logical.
