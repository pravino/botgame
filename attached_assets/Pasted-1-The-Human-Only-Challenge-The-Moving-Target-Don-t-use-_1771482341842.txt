1. The "Human-Only" Challenge: The Moving Target
Don't use a boring "1+1=?" math problem. Bots can solve that in 0.1 seconds. Instead, use a Spatial Tap Challenge.
The Logic: A small "Golden Coin" appears and moves randomly across the screen for 5 seconds.
The Task: The user must tap the Golden Coin 3 times before it disappears.
Why it works:
Anti-Bot: Most simple auto-clickers tap a fixed coordinate 
. They will miss the moving coin.
Gamification: It feels like a "Bonus Round" rather than a "Security Check."
2. The Frontend Implementation (React + Framer Motion)
You need to build a ChallengeOverlay.tsx component that triggers when the server returns a CHALLENGE_REQUIRED status.
typescript
// client/src/components/ChallengeOverlay.tsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export const ChallengeOverlay = ({ onResolve }) => {
  const [hits, setHits] = useState(0);

  const handleCoinTap = () => {
    if (hits + 1 >= 3) {
      onResolve(); // Calls POST /api/challenge/resolve
    } else {
      setHits(hits + 1);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/80 flex items-center justify-center z-50">
      <div className="text-center">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-amber-400 mb-4">Catch the Golden Coin!</h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-400">Prove you're human to continue earning.</p>
        
        <motion.div
          animate={{ 
            x: [0, 100, -100, 50, -50, 0],
            y: [0, -50, 50, -100, 100, 0] 
          }}
          transition={{ duration: 4, repeat: Infinity }}
          onClick={handleCoinTap}
          className="w-16 h-16 bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-amber-600 rounded-full cursor-pointer shadow-lg border-2 border-white mt-10 mx-auto flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-white"
        >
          {hits}/3
        </motion.div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
Use code with caution.

3. The "Guardian" Integration (The Middleware)
When your POST /api/games/tap detects suspicious activity, it should return a 403 Challenge Required response.
Backend: Flags the user session as CHALLENGE_PENDING.
Frontend: Catches the 403 error, pauses the game, and shows the ChallengeOverlay.
Resolution: Once the user hits the coin 3 times, the frontend calls /api/challenge/resolve. The backend clears the flag, and the user can tap again.
4. Why this protects your 15k Profit
Zero Frustration: Humans find it easy (takes 3 seconds). Bots find it impossible.
Retention: By making the "Captcha" look like a game, you keep the user in a "Play State."
Security: This prevents "Headless Browser" bots from draining your 50% Tap Pot while you sleep.
5. Summary of the "Founder Bonus" Tie-in
If a Bronze Founder passes the challenge, give them a tiny reward (e.g., +50 Energy) as a "Thank You." This reinforces that being a paid member is better than being a Free member.
