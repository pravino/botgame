⚙️ VOLT60 — Bronze Tier (Diesel V8) Interaction Design
🎯 Core Feeling

Player is no longer generating power manually.

Now they are:

Operating a powerful industrial engine.

They must control output, not create motion.

This psychological shift is VERY important for monetization.

🎮 Main Mechanic: Throttle Control
Primary Action

User presses and holds a Throttle Lever.

While holding:

Engine revs up

Power output increases

RPM needle rises

Release:

RPM drops gradually.

🕹️ Interaction Model
Option A (BEST — Recommended)

Vertical throttle slider

User:

Tap + hold lever

Drag up/down to control power level

LOW  → engine idle
MID  → optimal power
HIGH → overheating risk

This feels like controlling real machinery.

Option B (Simpler)

Tap and hold anywhere on throttle zone:

Holding increases RPM

Releasing decreases RPM

(Still works but less immersive.)

🟢 The Green Zone Mechanic (Core Gameplay)

You add an RPM gauge:

|----|----|====|----|----|
      70%–90%
      GREEN ZONE
Goal:

Keep RPM needle inside green zone.

Power Generation Logic
RPM Range	Result
Below 50%	Low power
70–90%	MAX efficiency ✅
Above 95%	Damage risk ⚠️
Reward Loop

If player maintains green zone:

Combo multiplier builds

Engine glow intensifies

Watts/sec increases

Daily USDT earning improves

🔧 Maintenance Events (VERY IMPORTANT)

This makes Bronze tier feel alive.

Every 20–40 seconds randomly:

Problems appear:

Oil leak

Loose bolt

Steam pipe rupture

Fuel injector warning

Visual:
Small flashing icon on engine part.

User must:
👉 Tap that exact part quickly.

If ignored:

Efficiency drops

RPM unstable

Earnings reduced

⛽ Fuel Tank System

New resource appears:

FUEL LEVEL: ███████░░

Engine consumes fuel while running.

User must:

Tap “Refill”

Spend earned coins

This creates economy pressure → upgrades.

🔥 Animation Behavior
Idle

Engine vibrating slightly

Heat shimmer

Soft diesel rumble

Increasing throttle

Engine shakes stronger

Exhaust smoke increases

Pistons animate faster

Lighting pulses

Perfect Green Zone

Gold glow accents

Stable hum sound

UI pulse feedback

🧠 Why Tap-and-Hold Works Here

Free Tier:
👉 effort = spinning

Bronze Tier:
👉 skill = control

You move player psychology from:

“Work harder” → “Operate smarter”

This is what makes users feel progression.

Core Inputs
onPointerDown → increase RPM
onPointerMove → adjust throttle position
onPointerUp → decay RPM
RPM Physics
if (holding) rpm += throttleForce
else rpm *= 0.985   // engine slowdown

heat += rpm * 0.002
fuel -= rpm * 0.001
Green Zone Check
if (rpm >= 70 && rpm <= 90)
   efficiency = 1.5x
else
   efficiency = 1.0x
Random Maintenance Event

Every interval:

spawnFault()

User tap clears fault.
